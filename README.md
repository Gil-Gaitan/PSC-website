# PSC-website IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

**Plant Seeds Cook** is a simple yet impactful website project focused on demonstrating backend development skills and functional tooling. The goal of this site is to provide a clean, minimal front end while showcasing the powerful backend systems that support it. THIS SITE IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## Project Overview
The website currently consists of a landing page created with HTML and CSS, designed with simplicity in mind to let the backend features take center stage. - Next stage of this app will implement a base page to utilize for each page.

This project is a demonstration of:
- Incorporating containerization (Docker) - This site is a Docker container.
- Building and interacting with databases - Next stage will allow users to interacet with a database
- Creating and utilizing APIs - next stages will introduce API availability using Flask
- Leveraging SQL for data management - SQL is used for next deployment
- Showcasing reports, security features, and more - Under Development

## Features
- Simple Web Design: A clean design that places emphasis on backend functionality. - Basic HTML is utilized for functionality
- Backend Integration: The frontend will communicate with a backend API, showcasing the full range of database interaction (CRUD operations). - Project Management methods will be implemented, investment in certifications
- Dynamic Data: Data from the backend will be used to populate the website dynamically, with sections such as "Currently Cooking" and "Unique Visitors." - This will be some initial exercises with HTML and Python/Flask

## Tools & Technologies
- **HTML/CSS:** For the front-end structure and styling.
- **Git:** Version control system to track and manage code changes. - In development
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent development environments. - Gaining experience
- **SQL/Database Management:** Create, update, and manage data in backend databases. - Utilizing Docker in next version
- **API Development:** Expose data via APIs that can be accessed. - Upcoming versions, Utilizing NBA_API
- **Unit Testing:** Ensuring reliability and performance of the backend logic. - WEAK POINT
- **MORE:** Due to rapid development and formation of a development team, Updates will be delayed until plantseedscook.com V2.1 Omega

## Getting Started
To get the currently deployed website running locally:

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-seeds-cook.git
cd plant-seeds-cook
```
**Install dependencies:**
(Add any installation steps required if you're using backend technologies like Node.js, Python, etc.)
Run the HTML file: Open index.html in your browser to view the landing page.

## Roadmap
This project will evolve with added backend functionalities:

- **API Integration:** Connecting the landing page to a backend system.
- **Database:** Implementation of SQL database and API routes to access it.
- **Authentication:** Adding secure authentication features.
- **Dynamic Content:** Fetching real-time data from the backend and displaying it on the website.
- **Unit Tests & CI/CD:** Implementing tests and continuous integration workflows.
