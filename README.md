# PSC-website

**Plant Seeds Cook** is a simple yet impactful website project focused on demonstrating backend development skills and functional tooling. The goal of this site is to provide a clean, minimal front end while showcasing the powerful backend systems that support it.

## Project Overview
The website currently consists of a landing page created with HTML and CSS, designed with simplicity in mind to let the backend features take center stage.

This project is a demonstration of:
- Building and interacting with databases
- Creating and utilizing APIs
- Incorporating containerization (Docker)
- Leveraging SQL for data management
- Showcasing reports, security features, and more

## Features
- Simple Web Design: A clean design that places emphasis on backend functionality.
- Backend Integration: The frontend will communicate with a backend API, showcasing the full range of database interaction (CRUD operations).
- Dynamic Data: Data from the backend will be used to populate the website dynamically, with sections such as "Currently Cooking" and "Unique Visitors."

## Tools & Technologies
- **HTML/CSS:** For the front-end structure and styling.
- **Git:** Version control system to track and manage code changes.
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent development environments.
- **SQL/Database Management:** Create, update, and manage data in backend databases.
- **API Development:** Expose data via APIs that can be accessed.
- **Unit Testing:** Ensuring reliability and performance of the backend logic.

## Getting Started
To get the website running locally:

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-seeds-cook.git
cd plant-seeds-cook
```
**Install dependencies:**
(Add any installation steps required if you're using backend technologies like Node.js, Python, etc.)
Run the HTML file: Open index.html in your browser to view the landing page.

## Roadmap
This project will evolve with added backend functionalities:

- **API Integration:** Connecting the landing page to a backend system.
- **Database:** Implementation of SQL database and API routes to access it.
- **Authentication:** Adding secure authentication features.
- **Dynamic Content:** Fetching real-time data from the backend and displaying it on the website.
- **Unit Tests & CI/CD:** Implementing tests and continuous integration workflows.
