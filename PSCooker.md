# Roadmap for [project]
# User: Lead Developer
# Date: 2021-09-23
# Version: 1.0
# Machine being used: MacBook Air M2 all software needed is installed
# IDE: Visual Studio Code
# 
# Project Overview
# This project will encompass three main components:
# 1. Data Engineering Pipeline: Utilize the NBA API to create and manage a database.
# 2. Backend Flask API: Provide an interface to interact with the database and serve real-time data.
# 3. Data Visualization and Algorithm Visualization: Create tools to visualize data and run algorithms.
#
# Technology Stack
# - Python
# - Flask
# - SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
# - Docker
# - HTML/CSS
# - JavaScript (for frontend interactivity)
# - APIs (RESTful)
# - Git for version control
# - Postman for API testing
# - Visual Studio Code as the IDE
# - Redis for caching and session management
#
# Project Breakdown
#
# Project 1: Data Engineering Pipeline
# 1. Research and understand the NBA API structure and endpoints.
# 2. Set up a SQL database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
# 3. Create a data pipeline to fetch data from the NBA API and populate the database.
# 4. Implement data cleaning and transformation processes.
#
# Project 2: Backend Flask API
# 1. Set up a Flask application structure.
# 2. Create API endpoints using Flask to interact with the database.
# 3. Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the database.
# 4. Use `jsonify` to return JSON responses from the API.
# 5. Implement authentication and security measures (e.g., token-based auth).
#
# Project 3: Data Visualization and Algorithm Visualization
# 1. Decide on visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js).
# 2. Create frontend components to visualize data fetched from the API.
# 3. Implement algorithms for analysis and provide options for user interaction.

# Additional Features
# 1. Implement caching mechanisms to improve API performance.
# 2. Add support for session management and cookies.
# 2. Create a frontend dashboard to display real-time data and visualizations.
# 3. Add support for user accounts and personalized content.
# 4. Implement web sockets for real-time updates and notifications.
#
# Best Practices
# 1. Keep your code organized and modular. Use separate files for different components (e.g., routes, models).
# 2. Write documentation for your API using tools like Swagger or Postman.
# 3. Use version control (Git) effectively with meaningful commit messages.
# 4. Write unit tests for your API endpoints and database interactions.
# 5. Continuously monitor and optimize database queries for performance.
# 6. Consider implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
# 7. Regularly refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
#
# End of Roadmap

# Project 1 Components
# 1. Data Fetcher: Fetch data from the NBA API and store it in the database.
# 2. Data Cleaner: Clean and transform the data before storing it in the database.
# 3. Database Manager: Manage the database schema, tables, and relationships.
# 4. API Server: Serve data to the frontend via API endpoints.
# 5. Authentication Module: Implement authentication and security measures.
# 6. Caching Module: Implement caching mechanisms to improve API performance.
# 7. Session Manager: Manage user sessions and cookies for stateful interactions.
